# TI BYTE Program 2025

This repository contains weekly QUCS simulation assignments completed as part of the **BYTE (Build Your Technical Edge)** workshop conducted by **Texas Instruments** in 2025.

## 🧠 About the Program

The BYTE Mentorship Program is a 6-week technical workshop focused on **Linear Circuit Design** and **Simulation**. It includes:

- Weekly lectures on core analog electronics topics  
- Hands-on circuit simulation exercises using **QUCS (Quite Universal Circuit Simulator)**  
- Quizzes to test understanding of the week's content  
- Interactive sessions with TI engineers  

### Program Schedule Overview:
| Week | Topic                                    |
|------|------------------------------------------|
| 0    | Voltage & Current Sources (Self Study)   |
| 1    | R-C Circuits + QUCS Setup                |
| 2    | Fourier & Laplace Transform              |
| 3    | Inductor Circuits                        |
| 4    | Diode Circuits                           |
| 5    | Buffers                                  |
| 6    | Operational Amplifiers (Op-Amps)         |
